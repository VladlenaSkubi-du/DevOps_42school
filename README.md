# DevOps_42school
Four projects:
* init (1st year)
* roger-skyline-1 (1st year)
* docker-1 (1st year) 
* inception-of-things (4th year)
with my small tutorials and the final results

# Init

An initiation project gives opportunity to discover system and network basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis.

The part 1 “Network” must be done on school’s Macs.  The part 2 and 3, “System” and “Scripting” must be done on a Debian virtual machine.

# Roger-skyline-1

This project follows Init where you have learned some of basics commands and first reflexes in system and network administration. This one will be a concrete exemple of the use of those commands and will let you start your own first web server.
This second project, roger-skyline-1 let you install a Virtual Machine, discover the basics about system and network administration as well as a lots of services used on a server machine.

You can choose which Linux OS you want to use in this subject. No use of techs like Traefik, no containers like Docker/Vagrant/etc...

# Docker-1

The aim of the Docker-1 project is to make you handle docker and docker-machine, the bases to understand the idea of containerization of services. You can see this project as an initiation.
Docker will help you better understand this specific tool, but also the various aspects of applications development using microservices.

# Grades
* Init: 100 from 100.
* Roger-skyline-1: 100 from 100.
* Docker: 108 from 125 (should be corrected)
